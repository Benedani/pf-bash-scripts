# Portfolio: Bash Scripts
Various scripts that I have written for internal use, and have no problem with releasing to the public. The main intention is demonstrating my experience in this field to employers, but there is a minor possibility that somebody out there might find these useful as well.

# About portfolio repositories
These repositories were meant to demonstrate how I write software, and to be able to say that I have a GitHub portfolio.

I plan to contribute to open source as well (in particular, eyeing a [certain Nintendo Switch emulator](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/) as well as Linux projects) - but financial stability has to come first. Without eggs, no chickens will be able to hatch.
